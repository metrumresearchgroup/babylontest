## Babylon should be able to initialize a project with minimum configs required for execution
**Product Risk**: medium

### Summary
Babylon requires a `babylon.yaml` file to be in the project directory primarily because itâ€™s necessary for users to be 
able to select which version of nonmem to run against. Curating this from scratch is painful and error prone, so the 
`bbi init` command should be able to do this automatically.
