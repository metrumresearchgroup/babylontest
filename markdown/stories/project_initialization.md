## Babylon should be able to initialize a project with minimum configs required for execution
**Product Risk**: medium

### Summary
Babylon requires a `babylon.yaml` file to be in the project directory primarily because itâ€™s necessary for users to be 
able to select which version of nonmem to run against. Curating this from scratch is painful and error prone, so the 
`bbi init` command should be able to do this automatically.

##### Automated Test Explanations
* TestInitialization : This test copies the scenarios down to the temporary working directory and initializes each
one. After `bbi init` is executed, the test verifies that a `babylon.yaml` file has been created and that it does
contain at least one NonMem key (which is required for execution).
