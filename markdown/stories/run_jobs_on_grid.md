## Babylon should allow users to run NonMem jobs on the Grid
**Product Risk**: High

### Summary
Babylon offers an execution mode called sge: `bbi nonmem run sge <modelfile>` that operates as a simple qsub wrapper for 
Babylon itself. It creates a `grid.sh` file that literally calls babylonâ€™s binary to execute from the context of a SGE 
worker node. This has both automated and manual testing because the automated test suite allows Babylon to create the 
script that SGE would take and run, but then manually executes it in an emulated fashion. We also manually test this 
on a metworx instance to make sure there are no errors based on the environment.

##### Automated Test Explanations
* TestBabylonCompletesSGEExecution : Using a drone-exec runner against an Metworx workflow, drone runs these tests
against an actual grid engine cluster. Babylon operates in normal SGE for this mode and after we have verified
the execution on the SGE host has completed, we assert the following:
    * NonMem completes execution: The generated LST file is evaluated for a completion time
    * NonMem creates output files: The test makes sure that certain expected files (*.cpu, *.grd) exist in the output
    directory after completion of Nonmem
    * After executing `grid.sh`, Babylon creates a shell script: In each output directory should be a shell script <`modelname`>.sh which is
      executed to perform the actual work.

* TestBabylonCompletesParallelSGEExecution : Similar to the above with the exception that parallel mode is requested for execution.
This means that not only does the output file contain the grid reference, but also secondarily that the node count on the grid.
    * NonMem creates a `grid.sh` script that would be executed by a remote worker.
    * NonMem completes execution: The generated LST file is evaluated for a completion time
    * NonMem references a Parafile: Looks through the generated LST file to locate the PARAFILE reference, indicating
      the execution happened in parallel
    * NonMem creates output files: The test makes sure that certain expected files (*.cpu, *.grd) exist in the output
      directory after completion of Nonmem
    * After executing `grid.sh`, Babylon creates a shell script: In each output directory should be a shell script <`modelname`>.sh which is
      executed to perform the actual work.
