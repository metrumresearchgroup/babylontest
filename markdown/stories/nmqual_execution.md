## Babylon should allow for NonMem Execution via NMQual
**Product Risk**: low

### Summary
Since NMQual has been used for an extended period of time, the option should be made available to execute nonmem the 
same way that autolog.pl did. By using the `--nmqual=true` flag on the run command, Babylon will specify autolog.pl 
syntax in its executable script, rather than the typical calls directly to nmfe.

##### Automated Test Explanations
* TestNMQUALExecutionSucceeds : Babylon is executed with the `--nmqual=true` flag. Because of this the shell script
generated by Babylon should look __completely__ different. As opposed to referencing `nmfe` directly, it should call
`perl -S autolog.pl ...`. This test ensures that the execution completes successfully, creates output files, and then
validates that "autolog.pl" appears in the shell script created by Babylon
